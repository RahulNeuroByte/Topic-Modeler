general spiritual state people specific feature homosexuality isnt specific feature homosexuality paul describes men men working unseemly describe act sure spirtual nature depraved also like sin idolatry sexual immoraity sin sprang depraved spiritual state result man glorifying god god thankful still act shameless homosexuality even considered acceptable case hand none passage contains explicit teaching subject rom really idolatry refers homosexuality passing everything sinful specifically elaborated new testament scripture condemn drug dealer ruled spirit rather letter free legalism also protects u sin spirit word two edged sword cut way think must careful totally throw leviticus law reflection god character true holy nature say god endorses homosexuality run problem homosexuality natural whatever mean wholesome endorsed god oppose sexual behavior narrowminded biggots would u believe condemnation leviticus condemnation midst sex sin condemnation nothing text say law limited temple prostitution good reason believe case furthermore male homosexual sex deathpenalty crime every sin elaborated new testament take look corinthian paul said one corinthian broken law even heard among gentile one father wife prohibition father wife leviticus new testament verse clearly condemns besides one notice paul say sin commiting adultery etc spoke one father wife notice also sexual condemnation leviticus mentioned specific context paganism either pagan coustom mentioned corinthian either matter fact taking one father wife wasnt even done among gentile plain blantant sin whether worshipping idol involved one commonly made claim paul simply never faced kind question trying deal encountered homosexuality context people would probably agree wrong never faced experience christian try act straight fail never faced christian trying define christian homosexuality fit general christian ideal fidelity seeing sexuality mirror relationship god man unfair take paul judgement homosexuality among idolater use make judgement question one reason u accept common argument paul probably face problem sin tough come especially without supernatural power homosexual sin difficult overcome heterosexual sin like lusting married woman sleeping around people opposite sex doubt even excuse god greater another reason reject ignores supernatural power god intervene kind situation many people set free sin power god sure may group tried change homosexual failed reflection people involved program god willingness ability change sinner program u formula may fail people need power god change whether involved homosexual sin sin claim question counsel homosexual christian entirely theological issue also pastoral one paul tendency see issue eating meat celebrating holiday uncompromising principle pastoral issue look carefully good people involved avoid insisting perfection would personally damaging example paul clearly believed acceptable eat meat wanted u avoid pushing people action personal qualm dont see come conclusion paul dealing pastorial issue encouraged people give liberty order spare others allow people continue sin difficult take example eating meat offered idol paul felt nothing wrong abstract sense eating meat yet advised believer sacrifice liberty eat meat order spare others paul never allowed people sin living holy tough paul wrote make provision flesh fulfill lust thereof roman go discourse sacrifice liberty order spare conscience others suppose sin people practice homosexual act since others consider sin using paul approach pastorial issue would otherwise homosexual sacrifice liberty celbate monogamously married member opposite sex paul never offer lesser sin homosexual marriage prevent people engaging may considered damaging sin another example paul obviously would preferred see people least circumstance remain unmarried yet unable certainly would rather see married state might tempted fornication yet marriage sin marriage holy something god ordains paul recognizes note creation story work enters human life result sin doesnt mean christian stop working saved actually adam put garden tend fell fell would toil ground danger trying cure attempt often fails end damage ranging psychological damage suicide well broken marriage attempt living heterosexual fail dependent totally god vunerable glorious position must transformed renewing mind way homosexual walk freedom like anyone else well imagine paul preferring see people longterm committed christian relationship promiscuity work genesis suggests wasnt part god original ideal either think relationship still vehicle people sharing god love im sure see people opposing view see conclusion like saying kill gun aresenic person overcome desire sleep goat would better sleep one goat person want sleep aunt would better sleep one aunt case people animal one sleep higher chance get disease deal physical aspect question whichever sin commited lead

think appeal straightforward think weve suggested constitution good idea clearly consider former primary situation point make pain point consitution may aginst new yorkers interest also want raise opposition basing advocacy unpopular principle horror appealing popular principle perhaps question whether constitution might written appeal principle rather appear believe written something else mind propoganda put supporter let honest something last time brought valid point argument simply propogranda cant know phill really mean obviously using argument designed convince well know hamilton dyed wool monarchist probably authoritarian extreme jefferson democratic impules would suggest mean determining opinion government dont consider wrote government dont propose mean exists determining true opinion thus true opinion died little help today opinion slightest bearing matter though argument true false regardless said theyre true false regardles said earth make point calling propogranda would seem irrelevent difficulty u poster seem considering argument may flawed longer apply modern society oh argument questioning dont believe longer apply thats think good argument im entirely happy situation obviously applied minority time dont think alone sufficient invalidate alive today one opinion could count upon men express careful study mechanism government necessary ongoing improvement required gave opinion certain area proved right area got wrong ensured mechanism adapt improve consititution happen willingness accept structural problem within u political system may require constitutional change solution since u constitution basis u political system change would require constitutional change particular case however fillibuster matter procedure tradition made part constitution senate less powerful house lord wed almost state house representative also fact british government much greater power american system principle practice yes principle less power less power british government today theoreticaly dependent monarch convention monarch seeking exercise power deposed subtly prime minister able identify politics national interest manner u president regularly phill discusing power legislative house prime minister member parliament analgous although badly u president please explain u house representative principle powerful house lord senate practice less suggesting writer constitution really intended powerful gosh darn thing ratified realized theyd forgotten put extra restriction senate disagree system slow simply designed handle less demanded handle somebody washington put whose name forget congress become everybodys city council one reason every level government rendered unable come decision decision pushed next higher level instead entry level political science course tell people want law implemented always choose level government attack present best chance getting want national interest group simply rational thing want federal government enact law rather state less people persuade less contribution make concerned abortion primarily concentrate federal level simply win battle little state battlefield extension extends insurance medicine question local government failed hasnt done dominated local interest thus nonlocal interest want locality abide rule cant get rule past local government thus since theyve got clout wrong place appeal next higher level impose lower mean let get real really need congres united state deciding x traffice light thus pattern carjacking need federal opposed local crime people want congress take power sell vote dont think rise special interest coincidence increased power congress congress capable quick action enough power time hand confined original jurisidiction allowed local autonomy start social welfare model instead current state subsidy motto would better placed plenty state money handed problem distributed basis power congress basis actual need bingo higher governmental ladder less actual need matter political power concentrated higher level people less cloud find reduced effectiveness order set school project new york state pay state pork defense contract agricultural subsidy etc precise state since need beat filibuster simply leave new york education new york remain unconcinved state union capable educating child thats want leave worry pork state since industry cant concentrate political power wealth rather must divide among state try get want individual voice relative impact problem fillibuster must buy state congress acquired much power sell pork case system government created failing operating set condition specifically wanted avoid namely concentration power would seem proper thing reduce power either house attempt grease wheel youll get system move quicker stupid thing would make sense make decision local level break machine free seizure redirect earth want redirect said sell pork get thing congress congres less authority sell pork retains authority enact national legislation within granted jurisdiction pork problem significantly reduced current block power simply absolve congress responsibility come decision current block essentially state inaction preferable action thus system weighted action considering government usually institution sole power enforce decision force consider bias making decision good thing pushing decision lower pyramid wont work unless lower level less corrupt case worse better difference lower pyramid legal legitimate authority matter constitution federal government b lower level power harder concentrate c get benefit imposing new deicisons everybody get see tried without national decision congressional action usually treat entire country whole yet even similar problem different area different solution may called often dont agree decision local state rep make least better option going city council shooting mouth id much rather majority law made accessible people hang around end put rather somebody far washington half million constituent im curious base assumption lower level corrupt fail see restriction implied otherwise placed veto could easily read mean put check democratically popular unwise executive opinion policy since arguing federalist paper would point phill brought federalist paper arguing fillibuster whether minority senator allowed hold bill claimed senate suppose far less powerful house contended nothing constitution writing indicated brought cant decide founder wanted based federalist paper argued never argued primarily referred constitution place small restriction senate house u constitution give almost reasoning work part reason given right bear arm ammendment well regulated militia justification ambiguous u constitution nutsandbolts document delcaration independence highbrow reasoning couple example though reasoning power tax reasoning power grant permit article section veto meant exceptional measure follows fact senate president meant revise legislation would three chamber legislature two furthermore separation power would much less distinct certain extend believe veto become something wasnt intended however also believe inevitable considering congress abuse power make bill say whatever want say unlike people think shouldnt worrying veto fine problem congress almost necessitates abuse limit constitution president veto power regarding bill previous president used veto number reason usually something agenda really curious single bush president abused veto record veto bush phill thats absurd bush veto one overridden go read fdr think thats anything resembling record reasonable restriction senator magic holy number upon law must based senator feel safe enough state constituency stand fillibuster isnt enough indicate sufficient question whether law good idea reevaluate point fact though majority opposed minority minority allowed win default inherently wrong biasing system action historically governemnt action u dealing issue bare minority large minority successful youre position imposing federal power diverse people federal government got something bare majority one earth sufficient enact law cover million people diverse place living radically different condition shouldnt supermajority required bill issue money bill relating short term proposal switching general question fillibuster specific bill dont see make difference change law presupposition favour status quo arguable sure arguable theyre arguing however requiring bring vote ensures theyll good argument something isnt based solely party line system simple majority given absolute power ignore minority minority ignored see positive thing im sure republican looking pork much democrat theyve got legitimate objection legislation question instead consider system minority automatically win superior completely happy system requires minority action since u history history carving population group implementing
